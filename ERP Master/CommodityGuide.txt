📌 Flow of Execution: How the Code Works Step by Step
This Selenium automation script tests the "Commodity Master" feature in a web-based ERP system. Below is the step-by-step execution flow of how the script runs:

🔹 Step 1: Test Initialization (setUpClass)
The test starts by setting up the Selenium WebDriver.
The Chrome browser is launched.
An implicit wait of 10 seconds is set (to handle delays in page loading).
💡 At this point, the browser is open but not doing anything yet.

🔹 Step 2: Login to the Application (login)
The browser navigates to the login page (http://192.168.0.72/Rlogic9RLS/Login).
Username and password are entered.
The "Login" button is clicked.
The test waits for the "Transportation" menu to appear (to confirm successful login).
✅ If login is successful, the test proceeds. If login fails, the test stops here.

🔹 Step 3: Navigate to "Commodity Master" (navigate_to_commodity_master)
The test clicks through multiple menus:
Transportation
Transportation Master
Common Masters
Commodity
Each click is explicitly waited for to ensure the menu is loaded before clicking.
✅ If the Commodity page opens, the test continues. If it fails, the test stops here.

🔹 Step 4: Switch to the Correct iFrame (switch_to_iframe_containing_element)
The web page may contain multiple iframes, so the script tries each one until it finds the required element.
It first switches back to the default page.
Then, it loops through all iframes and switches to each one until it finds the target element.
✅ If the correct iframe is found, the test proceeds. If not, an error is logged.

🔹 Step 5: Click "New Record" (add_new_commodity)
The test locates the "New Record" button inside the correct iframe.
It clicks the button to start adding a new commodity.
✅ If the button is clicked, the form opens. If not, an error occurs.

🔹 Step 6: Enter Commodity Details (fill_text_field)
The script locates and fills in two fields:
Commodity Name: "Footwear"
Commodity Code: "FTW"
For each field:
It scrolls to the field to make sure it's visible.
It clicks on the field to focus.
It enters the required value using JavaScript.
✅ If both fields are filled, the test moves to saving the record. If any field is missing, the test fails.

🔹 Step 7: Click "Save"
The script locates the "Save" button inside the correct iframe.
It clicks the button to save the commodity record.
✅ If saving is successful, the test is completed. If it fails, an error occurs.

🔹 Step 8: Close the Browser (tearDownClass)
Once the test is complete, the script closes the browser.
This ensures no leftover browser windows after the test.
✅ This step always runs, even if the test fails.
