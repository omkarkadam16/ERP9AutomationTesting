This method `switch_to_iframe_containing_element` is designed to switch the WebDriver's focus to
an iframe that contains a specific element identified by its ID. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The method takes an `element_id` as a parameter, which is the ID of the element we're looking for.

2. It starts by switching to the default content of the page using `driver.switch_to.default_content()`.
This ensures we're starting our search from the top level of the DOM.

3. It then finds all iframe elements on the page using `driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "iframe")`.

4. The code iterates through each iframe found:
   - It switches to the current iframe using `driver.switch_to.frame(index)`.
   - It tries to find the element with the specified ID within this iframe.

5. If the element is found:
   - It prints a success message with the element ID and the index of the iframe.
   - It returns `True` to indicate success.

6. If the element is not found in the current iframe:
   - It catches the exception (which is raised when the element is not found).
   - It switches back to the default content to prepare for checking the next iframe.

7. If the element is not found in any iframe:
   - It prints an error message.
   - It returns `False` to indicate failure.

This method is useful when dealing with web applications that use multiple iframes,
as it automates the process of finding the correct iframe containing a specific element.
This is particularly helpful in test automation scenarios where elements might be located in different iframes across
different pages or states of the application.
